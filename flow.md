Smart Contract Escrow System Documentation
1. Escrow Fee Policy
The escrow fee is charged only to buyers and included in the total payment deposited into escrow.
The escrow fee is fixed at $0.50 per transaction and will be transparently displayed to the buyer before confirming a trade.
If a trade is canceled or unsuccessful, the full payment, including the escrow fee, will be refunded to the buyer’s wallet.
2. Criteria for Users to Upload Products
Mandatory Full Contact Details: Sellers must provide valid contact information (e.g., phone number, email, or other forms of identification).
Wallet Connection: Sellers must connect a verified cryptocurrency wallet for secure payments and identity verification.
No Listing Fee: Sellers can list their products without any fee to encourage early adoption.
Product Review & Approval: Product listings will undergo manual review by the platform team to ensure quality and legitimacy. Automation tools will be implemented later.
3. Trading Workflow
Product Listing: Sellers upload products, including descriptions, images, pricing, and shipping costs. The platform manually reviews and approves products before they become visible.
Buyer Opens Trade: Buyers submit the total product cost, shipping cost, and escrow fee into the smart contract escrow. The platform informs the buyer of the total payment breakdown, which they must confirm before initiating the trade.
Trade Negotiation (Optional): A chatroom allows buyers and sellers to negotiate terms, finalize pricing, and discuss shipping details before trade confirmation.
Payment Escrow: Upon buyer confirmation, the total amount (product cost + shipping fee + escrow fee) is securely held in the escrow smart contract.
Seller’s Obligations: Sellers are notified when payment is secured in escrow. Sellers must accept concise policy terms before shipping, such as shipping timelines, refund conditions, and providing valid tracking details.
Product Shipment: Sellers ship the product and upload tracking details to the platform.
Trade Completion: Upon receiving the product, the buyer must click the 'Release Payment' button to transfer funds from escrow to the seller’s wallet. The escrow fee is deducted before the release of payment to the seller.
Dispute Handling: If a buyer does not release the payment or raises a dispute, funds remain in escrow until resolution.
4. Platform Features

Dispute Resolution: Disputes can be raised by either party. Funds will remain in escrow until the platform resolves the issue.
Punishable Offenses by Sellers: Any seller found breaching the agreed terms will face penalties, such as suspension of their account or legal prosecution, depending on the severity of the breach.
Automation Roadmap: Manual processes (e.g., product review and dispute handling) will transition to automated systems as the platform scales.
